#### Backend for processing and forwarding alerts from Grafana:

##### Functional features:
- Processing of webhook rules with the ability to generate images from the render plugin
- Skips the garbage rules of grafana version 9x when the backend drops off a lot of no_data
- It is possible to repeat alerts if nginx returns 429
- The transformation of the new alert to the old json format, if suddenly you use a bot and you don't really want to rewrite it
- Forwarding to webhook-based mail with the ability to refine the template for yourself
- Long-term storage of alerts in MongoDB
- Logging output for Clickhouse for further spam analysis of incorrect rules in grafana
